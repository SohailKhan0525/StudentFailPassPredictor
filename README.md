# 🎓 Student Pass/Fail Predictor

## Project Overview
This is a **machine learning-powered web application** built with Streamlit that predicts whether a student will **PASS or FAIL** based on their demographic and educational background information.

The application uses a trained machine learning model to analyze student characteristics and provide prediction probabilities for pass/fail outcomes.

## Features
- 🎯 **Interactive UI** - Easy-to-use Streamlit interface
- 📊 **ML-Based Predictions** - Scikit-learn model for classification
- 📈 **Probability Scores** - Shows pass/fail probability percentages
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Design** - Clear visualization of results

## Input Parameters
The model considers the following student characteristics:
- **Gender**
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Parental Level of Education**
- **Lunch Type**
- **Test Preparation Course**

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Streamlit** - For the web interface
- **Scikit-learn** - For machine learning model
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation
- **NumPy** - For numerical operations
- **Joblib** - For model serialization

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This application is for educational and demonstration purposes only.** The predictions are based on a sample dataset and **should NOT be used for real academic evaluation or decision-making.**

**Important Notes:**
- Model predictions may be inaccurate and should not be relied upon for actual academic decisions
- This is a learning project to demonstrate machine learning concepts
- Always consult with educational professionals for real academic assessments
- The model's accuracy depends on the training dataset and may not generalize to all populations

## Model Information
- The model was trained on a sample dataset
- It uses one-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Classification algorithm: Pre-trained scikit-learn classifier
- Output: Binary classification (Pass/Fail) with probability scores

## Usage Example
1. Select student demographic information from dropdown menus
2. Click the "Predict Result" button
3. View the prediction result with probability percentage
